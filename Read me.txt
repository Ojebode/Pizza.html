This was my first website deisgn in 2013 when i was learning HTMLand CSS. I named the website after my girl friend who is a 
medical Doctor and also loves Pizza, and yes, we are still together :)

I used Microsoft Expression Web for this project.

Main components of the site includes:
HTML pages
Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)
Images used for graphics
Javascript to iterate the banner image design.
